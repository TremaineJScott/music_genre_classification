# Music Genre Classification Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Music Genre Classification project! This repository contains the code and resources for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based AI model that classifies music tracks into different genres. The goal of this project is to automatically organize your music collection and create playlists based on genres, allowing you to enjoy your favorite tunes effortlessly.

## Project Overview

### What It Does
This AI program uses SVM, a powerful machine learning technique, to categorize music tracks into predefined genres. It does so by analyzing audio features extracted from each track, allowing for automatic genre assignment.

### Current Accuracy
As of the latest update, the model has achieved an accuracy of 0.19 on the validation dataset. While it's a promising start, there's room for improvement. We encourage contributors to work with the data and the model to enhance its performance and push the accuracy higher.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (Python, scikit-learn, etc.).
3. Explore the dataset in the 'data' directory and the code in the 'src' directory.
4. Train and evaluate the model using the provided scripts.
5. Experiment with different SVM configurations, feature engineering, or dataset augmentation to improve accuracy.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to help enhance this project. If you're interested in improving the model's accuracy, creating better playlists, or exploring new features, please feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## Challenge

We challenge you to work with the dataset and model, and see if you can achieve a better accuracy than the current 0.19. Whether you're an experienced data scientist or a beginner looking for a fun project, your insights and ideas are valuable. Let's collaborate and push the boundaries of music genre classification!
